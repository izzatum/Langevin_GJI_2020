Bayesian seismic inversion: A fast sampling Langevin dynamics Markov chain Monte Carlo
=========

This provides the implementation of the published GJI manuscript - Bayesian seismic inversion: A fast sampling Langevin dynamics Markov chain Monte Carlo. We used two packages for this research, the AIR Tools II developed by Per Christian Hansen (http://people.compute.dtu.dk/pcha/software.html) and the FWI solver developed by Tristan van Leeuwen (https://github.com/TristanvanLeeuwen/SimpleFWI/).

You need to download the SPOT Operator toolbox from http://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/spot/
